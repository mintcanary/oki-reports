          <h2>Understanding the drivers of licence proliferation</h2>
          <p>
            Open licensing continues to be a major challenge for the open movement. Licensors decide to create custom licences instead of using standard open licences. This so-called ‘licence proliferation’ is problematic for a <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/License_proliferation">number of reasons</a>. Custom licences necessitate that data users know all legal arrangements of these licences – a problem that standardised licences are intended to avoid by clearly and easily stating use rights. Because of these legal uncertainties and compatibility issues, licence proliferation can have chilling effects on the reuse of data and in the worst case prevent data reuse entirely.

            This paper looks at licence proliferation in the field of open government data. Why do governments open their data with custom licences? Who decides that custom licences are a better solution to legally open up public sector information? What are the benefits for government to create custom licences? And what can be learnt for better open licensing practices? Along the licensing process, there are several stages where governments can make decisions that lead to incompatibility or result in non-open licences. These stages range from open licence policy development through to the crafting of custom licence texts.

            This paper argues that a renewed debate around reader-friendliness, legal certainty, and compatibility across licences is needed. The paper explores decision-making processes within national governments defining what licence to use for data publication. It draws from interviews with government officials and document analysis. How are licences customised and are they always legally compatible? What tools are available to support open licensing at each stage of the licensing process? As such, this report wishes to provide a snapshot on the current licensing landscape within national governments and spark debate about the road ahead towards better licensing practices.
