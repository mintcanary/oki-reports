          <h2>Summary</h2>
          <p>
            The proliferation of new licences continues to be a major challenge for open data. When licensors decide to create custom licences instead of using standard open ones, it creates a number of problems. Users of open data face a burden of understanding the legal arrangements of these licences. Because of legal uncertainties and compatibility issues with many different licenses, this proliferation can have chilling effects on the reuse of data. Standardised licences can smoothen this process by clearly stating usage rights.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report provides a snapshot of licence proliferation in government. It explains why new licence terms complicate the licensing ecosystem and fail to resolve deeper issues around copyright and existing licence incompatibilities. The report makes a case for the use of existing reusable standard licences - above all <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">Creative Commons Zero</a> and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0</a>, and argues that a core issue of licensing is a lack of centralised coordination within government.
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand how governments can centralise and harmonise decision-making around open licences, the report discusses different phases along the licensing process including copyright and copyright reform, policy development, and the design of individual licences. It offers a first introduction on how licences are governed and outlines some persisting challenges and some best practices.

          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <p>
            We make the following recommendations for government agencies who wish to make their public sector information as reusable as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            When clarifying the legal context:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Clarify if data falls under the scope of copyright, database rights, or similar rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              Consider copyright reform if the protection status of public sector information is not clear. Grant positive use rights for public sector information within copyright law instead of adding many exceptions from copyright.
            </li>
            <li>
              If data is exempt from copyright and database rights, publish clear notices that inform users about their rights to freely reuse, combine and distribute information.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When designing policy and governance mechanisms:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Consider setting up inter-ministerial committees and similar steering bodies to align policies. Collaborate closely with representative bodies for lower administrative levels to align policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Develop a strategy how to align licensing schemes across policies. Executive orders may be faster to implement than laws, but less far-reaching. Laws may be more far reaching, but should be
            </li>
            <li>
              Policy tools should recommend standard open licences whenever possible and avoid vague language. Clearly define a small number of highly compatible open licences, at best Creative Commons Zero and Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compliance policies may be combined with the appointment of an agency overseeing and reviewing licensing decisions. These reviews should be designed that they can influence the uptake of a standard set of licences.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            When applying open licences to public sector information:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              If information is in the public domain, use legally non-binding notices. These must be clear and should inform users in a short and concise manner about their rights to use information.
            </li>
            <li>
              For information not otherwise in the public domain, use standardized open licences, preferably Creative Commons Zero and Creative Commons BY 4.0. They can be reused by anyone which helps ensuring compatibility with other datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              In cases where governments prefer to use a customized open government licence, these licenses should provide the least restrictions possible, and allow users to combine the data or works with other openly licensed artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
              An especially useful approach is to dedicate information to the public domain, combined with legally non-binding community norms for attribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              To guarantee a licence meets the open definition, we strongly recommend to submit the licence for <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/">approval under the Open Definition</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom licence must be compatible with widely used standard licences. Carefully verify if small ‘micro-elements’ in your provisions, such as parties involved, rights granted, or conditions, cause incompatibilities with other licences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compatibility statements help to give legal certainty to users. They must explicitly name the licences and licence versions compatible with a custom licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use notices to provide additional explanations and comments outside of the core licence text. This keeps the licence as simple and interoperable as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The licence should be clearly attached to the information to which it applies. Stable links to licences should be maintained (URIs) so that users can access licence terms at all times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Highlight the licence version and provide context how data can be used.
            </li>
            <li>
              When publishing data, avoid any confusing or contradictory elements such as copyright notices in website footers. Clearly separate a website’s terms of use from the terms of open licences. Some governments combine website terms of use with licence terms for open data, thereby adding to unclarity what terms apply for the use of public sector information.
            </li>

          <h2>The principles of open licensing</h2>
          <p>
            People invest time and effort in creating works. Intellectual property rights, including copyright or similar rights regulate who can use and exploit the works. The default legal status may restrict uses we want to promote and allow. Without clear licensing, the legal grounds for permitting those uses  can be unclear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open licences are legal arrangements that grant to the general public rights to reuse, distribute, combine or modify works that would otherwise be restricted under intellectual property laws. <strong>Licences are open, if they enable anyone to use works for any purpose</strong>, both commercially and non-commercially.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without an open licence, users face legal grey areas. “May I publish environmental statistics in a health app? Am I allowed to combine a city map with location information of companies?” Open licences help answering these and similar questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open licenses may be unnecessary for works not restricted by copyright or similar laws. Such works are considered to be in the ‘public domain’<sup><a href="#fn-item1" id="fn-return1">1</a></sup>. The details for which rights are recognized for public domain works varies by country but generally covers the full set that open licenses permit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/">Open Definition</a> defines how IP-protected works can be made available openly. This provides the framework for publishers to turn their data into open data, and can be similarly applied to other types of information, such as official government documents, journalism, art, and so on. Central to the Open Definition are nine <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/">requirements to legal openness</a>. According to these requirements, open licences must allow anyone to use data for any purpose with at most restrictions regarding provenance, such as attribution of contributors, rights holders, sponsors, and creators, and restrictions that  redistribution of adapted artifacts must use similar license terms. Publishers must comply with these requirements in order to open up their information. Open licences only address barriers posed by copyright but naturally do not supersede civic law or allow for unlawful behaviour.
          </p>

          <h3>Understanding different types of open licences</h3>
          <p>
            Open licences are described as either permissive or copyleft. If a work is licensed under a ‘copyleft’ licence, its terms and conditions must apply to works that will derive from and build on the original work. If a work is licensed under a permissive licence, the terms and conditions of a derivative work can be changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Open licences can refer to any copyrighted work, including content and/or databases. Depending on a country’s copyright law, content may include video, audio, written texts, and other works that are considered products of creative authorship. In the European Union and some other countries, other protections on databases exist, so-called ‘<strong>database rights</strong>’<sup><a href="#fn-item2" id="fn-return2">2</a></sup>. Database rights do not stem from copyright, but intend to protect investments made to build a database (sometimes referred to as ‘sweat of the brow’). In Europe, the Database Directive<sup><a href="#fn-item3" id="fn-return3">3</a></sup> includes provisions for the protections of  ‘non-creative’ data based on the investments made to compile a database. In the United States of America, databases are considered compiled work, similar to books or other works.<sup><a href="#fn-item4" id="fn-return4">4</a></sup> In the U.S., either the database records or the database structure need to be results of creative authorship to be protected. An alphabetical list of factual data is usually not considered to be protected.<sup><a href="#fn-item5" id="fn-return5">5</a></sup> Database rights therefore can either restrict content within a database from being used by third parties, or they can restrict the database structure and how it classifies and arranges content. While legally different, database rights and copyright have similar effects. They represent restrictions on the public use of information.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Open licences</strong> operate within a jurisdiction’s legal environment and <strong>only apply if a work is covered by copyright or related law</strong>. Several widely known licences address database rights. The Open Data Commons licences (<a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-odbl/">Open Database Licence 1.0</a>, (ODbL) <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/odc-by/">Open Data Commons Attribution Licence 1.0</a> (ODC-BY) were the first to address database rights. The <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-zero/">Creative Commons Zero</a> licence (CC0), as well as version 4.0 of the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by/">Creative Commons Attribution</a> (CC-BY), and <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa/">Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike</a> (CC-BY-SA) licences cover database rights as well as regular copyright. Beyond these re-usable standard licences, governments develop their own licences to cover database rights such as the Open Government Licence (OGL 3.0) or the Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data (NLOD). Recently, the Linux Foundation published their ‘Community Data License Agreement’ to address database rights.
          </p>
          <h3>Open licences: threat of use silos</h3>
          <p>
            Open licences are not all compatible with one another. Licences are compatible if people can combine works and distribute them under one of these licences, or a third compatible licence. Even if all licences are open, they may prevent users from mixing data under multiple licenses. Licences must be at least ‘one-way compatible’, meaning that a derivative work combining content under two licenses is legally feasible although the result may only be provided under the terms of the more restrictive licence. In a simplified graphic below we showed the example of combining parts of databases under CC BY and CC BY-SA. The resulting database can only be made available under CC BY-SA or a licence compatible with CC BY-SA, in order to comply with the licences of both original databases.

              Public domain is used in various legal systems, but in some countries it can be named differently. In general it means, that no copyright, database right, or any other restricting rights are applicable to this type of content or work. <a href="#fn-return1">↩</a>

            Governments need to be very careful not to create data use silos. We speak of silos whenever a data system is not compatible or integrated with another data system. Use silos arise legally if it is not possible to combine data from different sources, due to incompatible licensing. This problem becomes even more important as governments turn towards supporting the free flow of public sector information such as with Europe’s Digital Single Market strategy.<sup><a href="#fn-item6" id="fn-return6">6</a></sup> Licence compatibility and maximum simplicity of licences are paramount for creating effective data markets, economic growth through data, cross-border data sharing, and reuse of government data by civil society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fundamental differences and incompatibilities exist both between permissive and copyleft licences, and between different copyleft licences. For example, OpenStreetMap contributors often deal with and discuss incompatibility between CC BY-SA and the ODbL.<sup><a href="#fn-item7" id="fn-return7">7</a></sup> <strong>Open Knowledge International strongly discourages governments from creating new licences to avoid complicating the licence ecosystem further</strong>. For example, new licenses do not address the issues with open licences operating within specific environments of intellectual property protection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depending on varying laws, open licences can have differing degrees of applicability. Also creating more licences does not address fundamental incompatibility problems across already existing, and widely used open licences.

          <h2>Licence proliferation and why it is a problem</h2>
          <p>
            Licence proliferation occurs every time a new open license is created. First acknowledged by the open source software movement<sup><a href="#fn-item8" id="fn-return8">8</a></sup>, licence proliferation presents a major problem for the reuse of data. The following five issues of licence proliferation are especially problematic for open government data:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              New terms and conditions can <strong>cause incompatibility</strong> with existing licences. This can entirely prevent from using data or create use silos.
            </li>
            <li>
              New licences are not always reader-friendly and can <strong>cause legal uncertainty</strong> by including vague language.
            </li>
            <li>
              More licences <strong>increase the complexity of conditions</strong> set out for databases or other works because they require users to comply with all of them.
            </li>
            <li>
              Every new licence <strong>requires time</strong> for users to read and understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Writing an entirely new licence is time consuming and <strong>costs money</strong>. Standard licences on the other hand can be readily used.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            To address licence proliferation it is important to understand the difference between reusable standard licences and custom licences. As explained below, we strongly encourage that governments use standard licences that are reusable, in particular CC0 and CC-BY 4.0.
          </p>

          <h3>Standard licences</h3>
          <p>
            Reusable standard licences lay out terms that can apply to any licensor and licensee. They are not the result of individual negotiations between a rightsholder and licensee. If rights holders publish their works under the same reusable standard terms, they allow users to combine, modify, and distribute these works together. This helps, for example, to add value from combining different databases.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creative Commons and Open Data Commons<sup><a href="#fn-item9" id="fn-return9">9</a></sup> have developed standard licences that are publicly available and may be re-used by any licensor without any modifications. As a non-profit supporting others to legally share their works, Creative Commons developed several types of copyright licences with the goal to simplify and standardise the licence ecosystem. Open Data Commons is an initiative co-initiated by Open Knowledge International focusing on developing and maintaining legal tools to open data.
          </p>
          <p>
            Creative Commons and Open Data Commons both store their licences at a permanent URI and have a community supporting its updating. <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">The Open Definition endorses six reusable standard licences</a>, namely CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, ODbL, ODC-BY, as well as the public domain dedication licences <a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/pddl/1-0/">Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication Licence</a> (PDDL) and <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/">Creative Commons Zero</a> (CC0). It should be noted that CC0 and CC BY 4.0 are possibly the most commonly used ones<sup><a href="#fn-item10" id="fn-return10">10</a></sup> and are best suited for licensing public sector information. New reusable standard licences are very unlikely to replace other established licences.
          </p>

          <h3>Custom licences</h3>

            Custom licences (also referred to as ‘bespoke’ licences) are specifically tailored to individual public sector bodies and their relevant copyright. Tayloring licences to certain government bodies can cause a situation where other public sector bodies cannot reuse this licence but need to adopt a different licence.<sup><a href="#fn-item11" id="fn-return11">11</a></sup> Findings from the most recent <a href="https://index.okfn.org/">Global Open Data Index</a> show that governments continue to create custom licences. In a sample of twenty countries, we analysed <a href="https://index.okfn.org/download/">data available from the Global Open Data Index</a> and documented the terms of more than 50 unique licence texts.<sup><a href="#fn-item12" id="fn-return12">12</a></sup>

              A good example is the United Kingdom’s Crown Copyright. It applies to many government bodies in the United Kingdom but not to all public sector bodies.

          <h3>Recommended licensing choices</h3>
          <p>
            In order to address licence proliferation, <strong>Open Knowledge International strongly recommends following actions</strong>.
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Check if data is in the public domain:</strong> Verify if public sector information is in the public domain or protected by copyright and similar rights. If data is not protected, use a notice instead of a licence to give users legal certainty how data can be used. Recommended solutions are Creative Commons’ Public Domain Mark or a simple ad hoc mark clearly stating the rights of users.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Support copyright reform to put data in the public domain:</strong> If the protection status of government information is uncertain, copyright reform may be needed to give government legal confidence. This can include granting positive use rights by copyright law, or exemptions from copyright (the latter approach is discouraged for a variety of reasons<sup><a href="#fn-item14" id="fn-return14">14</a></sup>).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dedicate data to the public domain:</strong> If copyright reform is not a viable option, use a reusable standard licence for public domain dedication. To ensure simplicity and compatibility, it is recommended to use the CC0 licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pose least restrictions possible, at most requiring attribution and ShareAlike:</strong> If attribution is actively sought, apply a permissive standard licence such as Creative Commons Attribution 4.0. A softer approach is preferable which makes reuse easier, for example to request voluntary, norms-based, and not legally binding attribution statements. CC0 (+BY) is such an approach, using a public domain dedication licence, stating that attribution is expected, but not legally required.<sup><a href="#fn-item15" id="fn-return15">15</a></sup> ShareAlike licences should be used very carefully, as they rather support use silos.

          <p>
            The licensing process within government is complex. It includes several stages such as rights clearance, policy development, and the application of licences.<sup><a href="#fn-item16" id="fn-return16">16</a></sup> In order to avoid licence proliferation, public sector bodies should adopt one of the licences mentioned above. Under all circumstance licences need to be compatible with one another. But <strong>to date there is a lack of central coordination to harmonise licensing choice</strong>s and no self-regulation of the open licence ecosystem”.<sup><a href="#fn-item17" id="fn-return17">17</a></sup> The following sections discuss ways to harmonise licenses.

          <h3>Legal context: Copyright and similar rights</h3>
          <p>
            Open licensing starts with the interpretation of copyright law and similar protections. Copyright law can apply differently depending on the administrative level of government and the type of public sector body. For example, in the United States of America federal government data is by default in the public domain<sup><a href="#fn-item18" id="fn-return18">18</a></sup>, whilst state-level government data is protected by copyright.<sup><a href="#fn-item19" id="fn-return19">19</a></sup> Copyright may also apply differently depending on the type of public sector body. For example, in the United Kingdom, Crown Copyright applies to government agencies which have ‘Crown status’. Other public sector bodies that do not fall under Crown Copyright would possibly not be able to apply the same custom open licences that government bodies use. The Open Government Licence 2.0 and 3.0 address this issue by being applicable to rights beyond Crown Copyright.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Legal certainty:</strong> Jurisdictions can apply and clarify protections very differently. Sometimes law clarifies if public sector information is protected, in other cases an intellectual property office may be able to give answers. In other jurisdictions however the protection status of government information is unclear. This high degree of legal uncertainty prevents government and public sector bodies to put their data in the open.<sup><a href="#fn-item20" id="fn-return20">20</a></sup> Copyright reform can be the strongest mechanism to give legal certainty and to make government data legally ‘open by default’. For instance, central government may define that databases are exempt from copyright and similar rights. Copyright reform, at best across countries, can help to overcome the complexity of differing copyright exceptions and limitations.<sup><a href="#fn-item21" id="fn-return21">21</a></sup>

            <li>

          <h3>Policy and governance mechanisms</h3>
          <p>
            Governments can develop different policy tools to mandate licensing, ranging from laws to decrees, executive orders, and policies. Through policy development governments can execute different degrees of control over the licences that get implemented. But not all policy tools ensure a consistent uptake of open licences.
          </p>
          <p>
            This can partly be explained by vague terminology used in licence texts. We found provisions requiring to make data re-usable by applying a ‘widely used licence’. Such vague language makes licences a discretionary choice of individual government bodies. Clear language should be used, requiring the use of a specific licence, possibly also covering its updated licence versions. Alternatively, policies can mandate a location to store data such as data.gov repositories. This can be complemented with another policy clearly defining the terms of this repository.  Licence standards and licensing frameworks may also help to support a harmonised uptake of open licences (see box below).

          <h4>Licensing frameworks: How educational frameworks can help to adopt more consistent open licensing</h4>
          <p>
            Licensing frameworks are a noteworthy approach to harmonise the use of open licences.<sup><a href="#fn-item22" id="fn-return22">22</a></sup> These frameworks offer legal guidance material for government agencies as well as information material to support government agencies making better informed decisions about how to license data. Examples include New Zealand and Australia. The mission of New Zealand’s Government Open Access and Licensing Framework (NZGOAL) is
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            “to give guidance for agencies to follow when releasing copyright works and non-copyright material for re-use by others. It aims to standardise the licensing of government copyright works for reuse using Creative Commons licences and recommends statements for non-copyright material.”
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            NZGOAL does so 1) by setting out principles for open licensing and open access, 2) by actively promoting the use of standard (Creative Commons) licences and “no known rights” statements wherever copyright is unclear, and 3) by providing a review process how to license works including <a href="https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-online-training-videos/">online training material</a>. NZGOAL also clearly explains why New Zealand specifically endorses the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence thereby adding further clarification.
          </p>
          <p>
            NZGOAL was born out of the problem that different agencies in New Zealand interpreted Crown Copyright differently. Additional legal guidance was needed to understand which copyrights these agencies hold, and how they can open up information. By using a licensing framework that promotes standard open licences and standard licensing statements, the framework shall harmonise the use of common licences and reduce ambiguities within agencies.

            Enforceability of policy tools may differ, too. For example, executive orders may be developed and implemented faster, but will only affect bodies associated to the the issuing agency (such as a ministerial order). It is recommended to align policies and open licences across government branches and bodies. For example, an inter-ministerial committee can be appointed, to support a more coordinated policy development. In addition central authorities may be appointed to review licensing decisions of other government bodies. This supervision process can steer licensing choices. Yet, it does not entirely resolve the risk of developing and using incompatible licences.

            </li>
            <li>
              Compliance policies may be combined with the appointment of an agency overseeing and reviewing licensing decisions. These reviews should be designed that they can influence the uptake of a standard set of licences.

          <h3>Individual licensing</h3>
          <p>
            Ultimately, every licensor makes decisions what open licences to apply, as well as where to publish them and in what form. If governments see themselves in the need to create custom open licences, they should ensure compatibility with existing open licences. Their licences should be reader-friendly, and provide legal certainty. Creating a custom licence needs a careful balance across these three aspects. If a licence is reader-friendly and understandable, but conflicting with standard open licences, governments significantly hamper the usability of data. Likewise, if a licence is compatible with standard open licences but contains vague language it may divert users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Based on interviews and a close-reading of licence texts, we identified a list of arguments brought forward by government to create a custom licence. Not all of these customisations are legally required to address copyright issues. Here we explain these arguments can be addressed without harming compatibility with standard licences.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Branding and attribution:</strong> Custom licences can be intended to give confidence to government agencies if they carry the name of a country or are called ‘government’ licences. Yet, creating custom licences only for branding reasons is unnecessary because standard open licences allow governments to add their custom attribution clauses.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ensuring clarity of a licence text:</strong> The Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data (NLOD) contains clarifying comments. Since these comments are part of the licence text, they can be interpreted as legally binding. This can cause compatibility issues with the terms of existing open licences. Clarifying comments should instead be added as notices, outside of a licence text, ideally stored at a permanent address.

          <h4>What’s the difference between licences and notices?</h4>
          <h6>Licences</h6>
          <p>
            A text of legal validity, issued by a rightsholder to grant others specific rights that would otherwise violate the rights of the rightsholder. Terms and conditions, or terms of use, are sometimes deemed to be equivalent to licences. Some governments include individual licences in broader terms and conditions, for example adding an open data licence into a website’s broader terms and conditions
          </p>
          <h6>Notices</h6>
          <p>
            A notice is a document that clarifies applicable rules. In contrast to a licence, it does not grant rights or permissions to data users. Notices have the purpose to inform about legal context. This makes them especially helpful when governments want to add explaining comments to their licence terms. Notices are also the best way to clarify the absence of protections on data (public domain). There are some readily available standard solutions, such as the Creative Commons Public Domain Mark.

            <strong>Use restrictions to prevent illegal use of data:</strong> Governments may add restrictions how data can be used, sometimes written in an overly broad and vague manner. An example is a licence that was in use until recently<sup><a href="#fn-item23" id="fn-return23">23</a></sup> by the New Zealand Companies Office. The licence states that
          </p>
          <figure class="blockquote">
          	<blockquote>
          		<p>“You must reproduce the material accurately, using the most recent version. You must not use the material in a manner that is offensive, deceptive or misleading.” </p>
          	</blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            These terms raise several questions. What does accurate mean? When is the use of data deceptive or misleading? Another lengthy example of a Belgian licence states that:
          </p>
          <figure class="blockquote">
          	<blockquote>
          		<p>“You may only use the services if you can guarantee that you will not be using them for illegal purposes or those prohibited by these conditions for use. You must not use the services in a way likely to damage, hamper, overload or impede the operations of a server run by FPS P&amp;O or its partners or by a network connected to this, or in a way likely to disrupt the use and enjoyment of the services by another person.”</p>
          	</blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            There are multiple arguments against using these kinds of restrictive clauses. Firstly, open licences are not meant to include references to civil law (direct ones or indirect ones as in the example above). An open licence must only clarify use rights of data, based on intellectual property rights. They never supersede civil law. Secondly, restrictions can conflict with the <a href="http://opendefinition.org/od/2.1/en/">nine principles of openness outlined by the Open Definition</a>, increase legal uncertainty, and make licences incompatible.
          </p>

          <h3>Testing and clarifying licence compatibility</h3>
          <p>
            How can governments ensure and communicate compatibility between custom licences and standard open licences? First and foremost <strong>licence compatibility requires governments to ensure that their licence terms align with standard open licences</strong>. Even if governments create custom attribution licences, they can contain provisions that hinder the licensing of derivative works.

          <h4>How governments can verify compatibility with other licences</h4>
          <p>
            The LAPSI Licensing Interoperability report<sup><a href="#fn-item24" id="fn-return24">24</a></sup> discusses “micro-elements” in licences, and how critical they are in order to ensure compatibility across licences. These include, among others, the parties of a licence, licence issuers, licence application, the rights granted, conditions, as well as disclaimers. The report discusses each of these elements and how governments may ensure that every one of these is compatible with reusable standard licences such as CC0 or CC BY 4.0.
          </p>

        <div class="copy">
          <p>
            <strong>Compatibility clauses:</strong> Governments sometimes add compatibility clauses for custom licences. Some licences meticulously list different licences and licence versions, while others only include vague compatibility statements. For example the French Licence Ouverte includes a compatibility statement saying that:
          </p>
          <figure class="blockquote">
          	<blockquote>
          		<p>“To facilitate the re-use of the "Information", this licence has been designed to be compatible with each licence that requires at least the authorship mention. For instance, it is compatible with the following licences: - "Open Government Licence (OGL)" of the United Kingdom - "Creative Commons Attribution 2.0" (CC-BY 2.0) of Creative Commons - "Open Data Commons Attribution" (ODC-BY) of the Open Knowledge Foundation”</p>
          	</blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Taiwan’s Open Government Data License Taiwan 1.0 (OGDL-TW 1.0)<sup><a href="#fn-item25" id="fn-return25">25</a></sup> provides excellent compatibility by using a ‘one-way transition clause’. This clause ensures that users are able to combine works licensed under OGDL-TW 1.0 with a CC-BY 4.0 licence and automatically comply with the terms of OGDL-TW 1.0. The licence text states:
          </p>
          <figure class="blockquote">
          	<blockquote>
          		<p>“The License is compatible with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 International. This means that when the Open Data is provided under the License, User automatically satisfies the conditions of this License when he/she makes use of the Open Data in compliance with the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 International thereafter.”</p>
          	</blockquote>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Other licences leave more room for interpretation about what licences they are compatible with. Precision is necessary as to what licences are exactly compatible with a custom licence. As a report by Creative Commons Netherlands governments might state compatibility with multiple licences which are not compatible among each other.<sup><a href="#fn-item26" id="fn-return26">26</a></sup>

          <h4>Recommendations for licensing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If information is in the public domain, use legally non-binding notices. These must be clear and should inform users in a short and concise manner about their rights to use information.
            </li>
            <li>
              For information not otherwise in the public domain, use standardized open licences, preferably Creative Commons Zero and Creative Commons BY 4.0. They can be reused by anyone which helps ensuring compatibility with other datasets.
            </li>
            <li>
              In cases where governments prefer to use a customized open government licence, these licenses should provide the least restrictions possible, and allow users to combine the data or works with other openly licensed artifacts.
            </li>
            <li>
              An especially useful approach is to dedicate information to the public domain, combined with legally non-binding community norms for attribution.
            </li>
            <li>
              To guarantee a licence meets the open definition, we strongly recommend to submit the licence for <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/process/">approval under the Open Definition</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Custom licence must be compatible with widely used standard licences. Carefully verify if small ‘micro-elements’ in your provisions, such as parties involved, rights granted, or conditions, cause incompatibilities with other licences.
            </li>
            <li>
              Compatibility statements help to give legal certainty to users. They must explicitly name the licences and licence versions compatible with a custom licence.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use notices to provide additional explanations and comments outside of the core licence text. This keeps the licence as simple and interoperable as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
              The licence should be clearly attached to the information to which it applies. Stable links to licences should be maintained (URIs) so that users can access licence terms at all times.
            </li>
            <li>
              Highlight the licence version and provide context how data can be used.
            </li>
            <li>
              When publishing data, avoid any confusing or contradictory elements such as copyright notices in website footers. Clearly separate a website’s terms of use from the terms of open licences. Some governments combine website terms of use with licence terms for open data, thereby adding to unclarity what terms apply for the use of public sector information.
